This directory is used to store the dataset. The SUN-SEG dataset is created by processing 1000 images and masks from the Kvasir-SEG polyp segmentation dataset. We selected 500 of them for the training set, 250 for the easy test set, and 250 for the challenging test set.
Please note that during training, a new folder named 'SUN-SEG-Processed' is generated. This folder contains the further processed dataset, and we will not upload it here.
